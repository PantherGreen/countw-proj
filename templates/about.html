<h2>Welcome to my very first Django Project!! <br>This particular website lets you enter a text and
subsequently displays the total number of words in your text. Apart from this, it also
displays the number of occurrences of all the words in the text you have
entered in descending order of the number of occurrences. <br>I found it super cool !!</h2>
